#log_level:
	# -1 DebugLevel logs are typically voluminous, and are usually disabled in production.
	#  0 InfoLevel is the default logging priority.
	#  1 WarnLevel logs are more important than Info, but don't need individual human review.
	#  2 ErrorLevel logs are high-priority. If an application is running smoothly, it shouldn't generate any error-level logs.
	#  3 DPanicLevel logs are particularly important errors. In development the logger panics after writing the message.
	#  4 PanicLevel logs a message, then panics.
	#  5 FatalLevel logs a message, then calls os.Exit(1)
